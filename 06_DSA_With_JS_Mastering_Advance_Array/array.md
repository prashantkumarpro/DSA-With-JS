Got it 👍 Let’s **forget rotation** for now and focus only on the **Two Pointer Algorithm**.

---

## 🌟 What is the Two Pointer Algorithm?

It’s a technique where we use **two indexes (pointers)** to scan through an array or string, instead of one.

* One pointer starts from the **beginning**.
* The other pointer starts from the **end** (or somewhere else depending on the problem).
* We move them towards each other, or in some coordinated way, until a condition is met.

---

## 🔑 Why Two Pointers?

* Saves time (usually reduces `O(n^2)` to `O(n)`).
* Avoids unnecessary nested loops.
* Very common in **DSA & interviews**.

---

## 📘 Common Patterns of Two Pointers

### 1. **Opposite Ends** (start and end)

* Pointers: `left = 0`, `right = n-1`.
* Used when you need to process from both sides.
* Example problems:

  * Check if an array/string is a **palindrome**.
  * Find **two numbers that sum to a target** in a sorted array.

👉 Process: Compare `arr[left]` and `arr[right]`, then move pointers accordingly.

---

### 2. **Same Direction (Sliding Window)**

* Pointers: both start from left.
* One pointer moves faster (expanding window), the other moves slower (shrinking window).
* Example problems:

  * Find the **longest substring without repeating characters**.
  * Find **smallest subarray with a sum greater than X**.

👉 Process: Move `right` to explore, move `left` to shrink.

---

### 3. **Fast and Slow Pointer**

* One pointer moves 1 step at a time (slow), the other moves 2 steps (fast).
* Example problems:

  * Detect cycle in a linked list.
  * Find the middle element of a linked list.

---

## 🔎 Intuition

Two pointers **divide the work**: instead of re-checking elements with nested loops, they coordinate to cover the array efficiently.

---

## ✅ Example Without Code (Palindromes)

Array: `[r, a, c, e, c, a, r]`

1. `left = 0` (`r`), `right = 6` (`r`) → match → move both.
2. `left = 1` (`a`), `right = 5` (`a`) → match → move both.
3. `left = 2` (`c`), `right = 4` (`c`) → match → move both.
4. `left = 3`, `right = 3` → crossed → stop.
   ✅ It's a palindrome.

---

⚡ So in short:
The **two-pointer algorithm** is not a single algorithm — it’s a **technique** that adapts to different problems by moving two indexes smartly.

---

### Let’s go through the **Reverse Algorithm** for array rotation — step by step

### 🌟 The Problem

We want to rotate an array (left or right) by `k` steps.
Example:

* Array = `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
* Left rotate by `k = 2` → `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`

---

### 🔑 The Idea of Reverse Algorithm

Instead of moving elements one by one, we use **reversal (flipping order)** to do it in-place, with **O(n)** time and **O(1)** extra space.

---

### 📘 Steps for **Left Rotation by k**

Suppose:
`arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `k = 2`.

1. **Reverse the first k elements**

   * First part = `[1, 2]`
   * Reverse it → `[2, 1]`

   Now array looks like: `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5]`

---

2. **Reverse the remaining n-k elements**

   * Remaining part = `[3, 4, 5]`
   * Reverse it → `[5, 4, 3]`

   Now array looks like: `[2, 1, 5, 4, 3]`

---

3. **Reverse the whole array**

   * Reverse `[2, 1, 5, 4, 3]`
   * Result → `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`

✅ Done! Array is rotated left by 2.

---

### 📘 Steps for **Right Rotation by k**

If we want right rotation, we just tweak the order of reversals:

1. Reverse the last `k` elements.
2. Reverse the first `n-k` elements.
3. Reverse the whole array.

---

### 💡 Why does this work?

Reversing parts and then reversing the whole array **restores the correct relative order** after rotation.
It’s like flipping sections of a rope, then flipping the whole rope to straighten it out in the rotated position.
